# 3D-Flocking-In-Unity
A boid system for flocking birds.

My goal with this project is to create a system of birst that will follow flocking rules to create murmerations. In order to have a large number of birds, I anticipate having to create some kind of data structure to only assess birds that are close to one another. A few years ago I followed a tutorial by The Coding Train to do this in javascript using a quadtree in 2D. This time I will attempt a 3D scenario.
